# fogidx uses the Fog Index to determine readability of a submitted text
# sample.  The idea is, you take the number of words, divided by the number of
# sentences, add that to the percentage of so-called big-words (the percent of
# words with three or more syllables) and then multiply the result by .4.  The
# resultant number should be an approximate reading level of the text.
# 
# the formula for the Fog Index is readily available on the Internet but should
# be approximately as is described above.  I got my particulars from 
# http://www.fpd.finop.umn.edu/groups/ppd/documents/information/writing_tips.cfm
