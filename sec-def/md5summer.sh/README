INSTALLATION
	This is no-brainer easy... 
	1) un-pack the tar-ball (chances are good you've made it this far if you're reading
		this.
	2) do a `cp md5summer.conf.orig /etc/md5summer.conf`
	3) edit /etc/md5summer.conf to include the files/directories you want md5sum'd
	4) move md5summer.sh to /usr/sbin or /usr/local/sbin 
	5) `mv md5summer.sh.8.gz /usr/share/man/man8/md5summer.sh.8.gz`
	5) setup a cron job to run md5summer.sh as frequently as you would like 
		(see also `man cron`)
	6) to verify your files are in tact, run an 
		`md5sum --check /path/to/the/results/of/md5summer`

	Note: I'm too lazy to just write a quick install script, even though I probably 
	could have done that quicker than writing these instructions.

USAGE
	I recommend you set up a cron job to run md5summer on a weekly basis, and a second 
	cron job to run `md5sum --check` on the results of the run of md5summer.  Grep the 
	results of your `md5sum --check` for "FAILED", that will tell you which files have 
	changed.  

	That isn't too complicated is it?
