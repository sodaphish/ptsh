-----------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: 

	PortWatcher is basically a package to seek and destroy skript
kiddie attempts at portscan/strobe/nmap probes.  The point here is to 
automate the task such that you don't have to do this by hand, or pay
for some big expensive IDS program.  

	I wouldn't recommend using this in a commercial setting, but
it's effective for home, and may actually be educational.  ("may" 
being the key phrase there.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

	This is pretty simple: 
	1) un-pack the archive on your hard disk
	2) move the un-packed directory (in its entirety) to some 
		final destination on your disk (I recommend 
		/usr/local/portwatcher, but that's up to you.)
	3) edit the file $PORTWATCHER_HOME/portwatcher.conf and change
		local settings (just read through it, there isn't
		much, but you should understand what's configurable 
		and what isn't.  There is also additional documentation
		in the config file, so just do it.)
	4) cd to $PORTWATCHER_HOME and run `mkmonitor`, which will 
		automatically generate a ton of different monitors
		according to what services are defined in /etc/services
		
	5) edit the file $PORTWATCHER_HOME/portwatcher.conf and adjust
		the array of @monitors_to_start to reflect the ports
		that someone might believably think you have open -- 
		OR, you can just add to that list whatever services
		are closest to 1, that way if you're dealing with real
		moron script kiddies their first few ports they hit 
		will automatically get them blocked for future access.

	7) add the listener to /etc/rc.d/rc.local. 

	6) edit your /etc/rc.d/rc.local script to run each of the monitors
		you defined in the config file (this is a temporary step
		until I can get the start_monitors script working.)
		NOTE: Make sure these entries FOLLOW the listener, or
		you'll have problems.

	8) re-execute /etc/rc.d/rc.local (this will get it all going)

	9) you can test it at this point, but be sure you know how to
		remove rules from IPChains by hand, 'cause once your
		IP is blocked, you're done (don't do this to machines 
		you don't have a console setup on.)

	That should do it, but this process will change rapidly as I
get the actually start and stop scripts going, and as I make the other
necessary changes to all of the listener and monitor code.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:

	This package requires several Perl5 modules that absolutely
MUST be present and working on your system BEFORE you try to get this
to run.  They are:

	- Storable 
	- IPC::Shareable
	- IPChains
	- Sys::Hostname
	- Sys::Syslog

If you find that you need additional packages to make PortWatcher work,
please feel free to contact me.

BUGS:

	I'm sure there are some.  Please, (pretty please?) notify me
if you see behavior that you think isn't quite normal.  Because of the
nature of this software, it is very important that bugs be fixed as 
quickly as possible.

	At some point, I will be posting a bug-tracking system to the
web-site, or opening a page at SourceForge, so if you're interested, 
stay tuned.
