o  improve monitors' socket connection/control to the listener (so if the
	listener dies away, the monitors know about it and go too.)
o  improve method of 'authenticating' monitor connections... presently 
	by host only.
o  add levels of verbosity for the syslog logging routines.
o  add optional e-mail notification on-blocking of host.
o  document the config file
o  add code to do some 'investigating' on the 'attacking' host before we
	cut them off at the knees.  this report (of sorts) could be 
	e-mailed to an administrative contact.
o  include code to expire blocking chains that have been in place for a 
	long time (how likely is jonny skript kiddie going to be at tryin
	to port scan the same box twice unless he's focused?)
o  write scripts to mangle the pwatch chain in IPChains so the user can
	be ignorant of how to mangle IPChains by hand.
