# pixbkup v.0.1.0 by C.J. Steele <csteele@good-sam.com>
# 	created: 28 Jul 2003
#
# This script uses `telnet` and the perl module 'Expect', to telnet in to
# the specified PIX devices and log the results of the `wr t` command to 
# a log file which is generated on-the-fly.
# 
# The resulting 'log' file needs to be slightly altered prior to attempting
# to import the config in to a running PIX, and great care should be taken
# before attempting to do so.  Anyone remotely familiar with PIX 
# configurations should have no problem altering the 'log' file to a point 
# that is is useable on a running PIX.
# 
# This script should be setup to run via cron on a nightly basis, with both
# stdout and stderr being redirected to /dev/null so password hashes aren't
# transmitted/stored via e-mail.
#
# TODO/ROADMAP
# - support different passwords on different devices. (v.0.2.0)
# - improve error checking during logfile creation (v.0.2.0)
#
