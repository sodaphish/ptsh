To use the sample code provided, simple run the resultant 
execuatble after performing a make. The binary expects a
directory as argument. It will segfault otherwise ;) 



For example: 
dowem@Heliotropic:~/Inotify-article/inotify-sample $ ./inotify_test /home/dowem


This begins a watch on the directory /home/dowem. 
From another terminal simply perform some file creations, deletions etc, 
and watch as the information is presented in real time from the sample
executable. 


I hope the code is a gateway to your further understanding of the inotify
Linux kernel mechanism. Happy hacking!
