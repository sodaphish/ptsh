# pao is a utility to help performance tune a Cisco PIX's ACL's.  It 
# relies on dpixsh and pao.pl to function.  Simply complete the path 
# information for DPIXSH and PAOPL, and you should be able to run pao 
# according to the following usage:
# 
#	 pao <aclname>
#
# where <aclname> is the name of the access-list to inspect
# 
# you could also substitute pao.py for pao.pl... if you haven't got a 
# perl install
# 
DPIXSH="/root/cjs-bin/pix/dpixsh"
PAOPL="/root/cjs-bin/pix/pao.pl"
