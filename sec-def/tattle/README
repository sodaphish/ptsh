`tattle` automates the task of reporting ssh brute-force attacks.  It should
work with minimal fuss: simply tell `tattle` where to find the sshd logs, what
your email address is, and what domains to exclude, install it in cron, and
away you go.  The majority of these steps involve editing the top portion of
the script, directly.  Doing so should be pretty straight-forward.
