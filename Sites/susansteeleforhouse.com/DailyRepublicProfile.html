	<p><b>1.  What is the biggest issue facing the state legislature in 2007?  If you are elected, what will you do about it?</b></p>
	<p> Energy development, economic development and education funding will be three of the top issues in the 2007 session.  South Dakota is ranked 4th for wind energy potential in the United States.  I would support incentives to build the transmission lines to develop this great natural resource.  Economic development comes in all sizes.  I would support the use of REDI funds to develop business growth in businesses of all sizes.  The 2007 Legislature must address funding for education, which is covered more fully under question 2.</p>    
	<p><b>2.  Some schools seem in trouble financially in the state, evidenced by the number of tax opt-outs in recent years and also from the funding lawsuit being pursued by a group of schools from across the state.  Should school funding be increased?  How?  And what can be done in the future to avoid financial trouble in South Dakotas schools?</b></p>
	<p>The South Dakota State Constitution guarantees that all children are entitled to a free, adequate and quality public education.  Schools have multiple roles in preparing our young people for the future.  After graduating from high school, some students will continue their education in technical schools or college, and other students will join the armed forces or the work force.   One purpose of education is to prepare young people to find meaningful employment, to compete effectively in the economy and have opportunities for advancement.  Education is also prepares young people for citizenship.  Democracy relies upon an informed and educated citizenry, we need people who can function productively as capable jurors and voters.  About 80 percent of the States 168 school districts have opted out of the property tax limits and 60 schools have joined in a law suit against the State of South Dakota seeking changes in the funding formula.  The 2007 Legislature will be charged with careful consideration of the points made in the adequacy study, the recommendations of the task force report which  is due November 19th, the legal arguments raised in the law suit and the opinions and proposals of educators, parents and citizens.   I am not in favor of trying to solve the funding issue by spending principal out of the reserve funds.  I will seek a  legislative approach  that  addresses funding on a longer term basis. </p>
	<p><b>3.  The death penalty was a big issue in 2006.  What are your thoughts about it, and how will you vote if asked to decide its future?</b></p>
	<p>Under South Dakota law, the death penalty can only be imposed if the offense is punishable by death and one or more aggravating circumstances are present.  South Dakota law sets forth several aggravating circumstances, such as, if ...[t]he offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible, or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim....   SDCL 23A-27A-1(6). Any appeal of a death penalty sentence is directly to the South Dakota Supreme Court, which is required to consider specific factors set forth by statute.   These safeguards insure that the death penalty would be rarely given and only in the most egregious cases.  I would not seek to repeal the death penalty, however, would favor revision of the intravenous administration statute that does not meet current medical standards.</p>
	<p><b>4.  Should the State Fair stay open in Huron?  Should state government subsidize it?  If so, how much?</b></p>
	<p>The State Fair is an educational and cultural tradition.   The 4-H participants and people  from east and west get together as South Dakotans.   The Fair should be maintained, and, like other state fairs, will most likely need continued state subsidization.  The State Fair Board should be encouraged to continue experimenting with cost saving measures, such as cutting back to the five day format followed in 2006.      </p>
	<p><b>5.  If voters reject the abortion ban in November, should the Legislature continue to pursue abortion issues, such as rewording the abortion ban? </b></p>
	<p>I am pro-life and will be a vigorous advocate for families.  If the referred law on abortion is rejected in November, the voters will ask their Legislators to introduce new legislation in the 2007 session.  I believe that life begins at conception and would be willing to sponsor or co-sponsor legislation that protects the lives of unborn babies.</p>
	<p><b>6.  Should South Dakota close one or more of the public universities?  What should happen at the Sioux Falls campus in the next four years?</b></p>
	<p>South Dakota has a total  record enrollment of 30,901 for 2006.  Due to a change in admission requirements, there may be a slight decline at School of Mines and NSU, however, overall enrollment is strong.  South Dakota will face the challenge of declining numbers of  high school students.  The Board of Regents reports a net gain of students from several states with which we have reciprocity agreements.  Additionally, recruitment of non-traditional students will be stepped up.  At the present time, South Dakota should not close any of the public universities.  The Sioux Falls campus is a cooperative effort of the state universities, with the four east river campuses offering courses at the present time.  Enrollment increased 2.9% this fall.   The Sioux Falls campus is meeting the needs in the most densely populated part of the State, however, the degrees are granted by the existing state universities.  The current arrangement appears to be working and should be left in place for the next four years.     </p>
	<p><b>7.  If elected, list any legislation you would like to introduce or sponsor during the 2007 session.  Also, please list why its important and its impact on the state. </b></p>
	<p>South Dakota is a great state to live in, work and raise a family.  If elected, it will be my goal to preserve, protect and enhance our great quality of life.  My roots are deep in South Dakota.  Both sides of my family homesteaded in Aurora County.  I was born in Mitchell and am the fifth generation to live and work in Aurora County.  If elected, I pledge to be a conscientious and hard-working  legislator with an open door policy.   It is very important to me to get regular feed-back from individuals with a wide variety of view points.    I also pledge to work in a bi-partisan manner and I will concentrate on getting the business of the people done.  When all is said and done, it is the values of the legislator that guides what legislation he or she may sponsor or co-sponsor.  I was raised with South Dakota values and those are the values that would guide my actions as a  legislator.    </p>
