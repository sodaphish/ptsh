			<p><b>1. Please tell us something about yourself  - Family, Education, Profession, Organizations, Affiliations, Hobbies, Interests, etc.</b></p>
 
			<p>My name is Susan Steele, I am married to John Steele and we live in Plankinton where we both work as lawyers.  John and I have two married children and five grandchildren. I am grateful that we have been able to raise our family in an area that truly allows people to live as a community - caring about each other and helping each other.   For leisure, I especially enjoy time with family and friends and love camping and canoeing. </p>
			<p>Community and church activities have always been very important to me and I have been active in a variety of ways over the past 28 years.  My volunteer experiences have helped prepare me for service in the Legislature.  Serving on the Queen of Peace Hospital Board of Directors for 7 years has provided an orientation for health care issues.  Six years on the Plankinton School Board has given me insights into education matters.  One of my favorite volunteer jobs was serving as a Girl Scout leader with Shirlee Weich and Kristie Saville.  We had as much fun as the girls.</p>
		<p>Education is vital for our young people and I want them to have the kind of opportunities that I was fortunate enough to have.  Both my M.A. (Masters Degree) in Political Science/Public Administration and my J.D. (Law Degree) are from the University of South Dakota.</p>

		<p><b>2.  Why do you want to serve the voters of District 20 in the State House of Representatives?</b></p>
		<p>When I was thirty - something, Adeline VanGenderen said to  me, on more than one occasion, Kid, you should run for the Legislature.   The kid is now 55 years old!  Adeline, and a few others, planted the seed.  Mabel Fitzgerald used to remind me how lucky I was to be able to go to law school, and shed add, Now, use it.</p>
		<p>My roots go back five generations in Aurora County.  I love South Dakota.  This is a great place to live, work and raise a family.  I want to preserve, protect and enhance all of the good things about our State for future generations.</p>
	<p>I would consider it a great privilege and honor if you would elect me to serve as your State Representative.     If elected I pledge to work in a bi-partisan manner and will concentrate on the business of the people.   When all is said and done, it is the values of the legislator that guide what legislation he or she may sponsor, co-sponsor or vote for.  I was raised with South Dakota values and those values would guide my actions as a legislator.</p>
	<p><b>3.  What three issues do you see as the most important facing South Dakota in the next five years?</b></p>
	<p>Funding of k-12 education is a critical issue for the Legislature to address.   About 80% of the States 168 school districts have opted out of the property tax limits and 60 schools have joined in a law suit against the State of South Dakota regarding inadequate funding of education.  The 2007 Legislature must address this issue with the intent of finding long-terms solutions rather than a piece-meal fix.</p>
	<p>Economic development continues to an important issue facing South Dakota.  Emphasis must be placed in particular on economic development in the rural areas of the State.  Job opportunities will attract and retain young families.  Development will result in higher school censuses and contribute to a vibrant main street.   Healthy smaller communities support the regional centers as well.  The economic future of South Dakotas larger and smaller communities are interconnected and interdependent.</p>
	<p>Energy development has tremendous potential for South Dakota.  Ethanol and wind energy are two energy sources which are very compatible with our resources.  I would support incentives for renewable energy resources. Development in these areas would be good for the State and the Nation.</p>
	<p><b>4.  If an 18 year old, registering to vote for the very first time, asked why they should become involved in their government?  What would your response be?</b></p>
	<p>First, Id ask them what freedoms and privileges they enjoy by being a citizen of the United States of America.  Second, wed discuss the fact that freedom isnt free and that there are duties and responsibilities that are also part of citizenship.</p>
	<p>There are many ways that people can serve their country, however, I would stress the importance of voting as a minimum requirement of citizenship.  A democracy depends on an informed and educated citizenry.  We each have the duty to become informed on the issues and to exercise our right to vote.  It has always been a source of pride to me that South Dakota regularly has one of the highest voter turn-outs in the United States.  Beyond that, I would encourage the young person to examine his or her gifts and talents and to use them for the betterment of society in any way that they can.</p>
	<p>I would also like to take this opportunity, from the bottom of my heart, to thank our young people who are defending our liberties by serving in the military - we owe a great debt of gratitude to each of you.</p>
	<p><b>5. Who is an important role model for you?</b></p>
	<p>Many people have inspired me in many different ways, but, I am going to mention two special people.   Those of you who knew my Grandma Esther Hanten will not be surprised to learn that when I was growing up, Id hear her say We are here to serve.  More importantly, she didnt just say it, she lived it.  Her strong emphasis on service to church, community and country was inspirational and has been a life-long influence for me.</p>
	<p>Father Alex Bombara is also an important role model for me.  More than any other person I have known, Father Alex exemplifies Christs love for one another.  St. Francis said, Preach always, use words if necessary.  Father Alex doesnt need any words.</p>
