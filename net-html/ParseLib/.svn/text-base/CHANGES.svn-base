v1.2.2
  o  there is now recursive expansion of tokens (this can 
     be a bad thing, such as if you didn't have a token that 
     you called in your template defined, you would end up
     with an infinate loop.)
  o  updated the documentation quite a bit.
  o  Output() can handle recieiving an file-handle or other
     output handle as a variable, and then send the output
     to that location instead of STDOUT.

v1.2.1
  o  you should be able to use '=' in variable assignments now.
  o  documentation needs updating, but that's okay.

v1.2.0
  o  I added the support for pipe-ing the output of an
     executed program (or script) into a variable.  
  o  I updated documentation to reflect new changes
     
v1.1.0
  o  I added the support for file includes in this rev
     again. I also added some super diga documentation. 

v1.0.0
  o  third release, but it was a complete re-write, 
     restructured the API, and added a lot of other 
     whiz-bang features.  If you understand Perl, you 
     should read the code and check out the features.

v0.1.0
  o  second release, added support for including files

v0.0.0
  o  initial release, supports variables and sections
