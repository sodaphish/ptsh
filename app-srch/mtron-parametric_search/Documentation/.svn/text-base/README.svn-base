Rules: 
1) NEVER EVER edit any of the source code outside of the SOURCE tree ...presently
	(12/15/2000) that is /home/csteele/devel.
2) NEVER install the source from the SOURCE by hand, ALWAYS use SOURCE/bin/mk[test|live]
3) If you need to change a configuration file, change the .m4 file, NEVER EDIT the .pl
	or the changes will not be synchronized across both the test and live systems.
	Also, note that if a change needs to take affect in BOTH systems, you absolutely
	must make the change in both the FILE.test.m4 and FILE.live.m4, or the change
	will not take affect across both systems.
4) the last nightly backup of the 'web' database is stored in SOURCE/sql/backups/web.last
	the same applies for the backup of 'mysql', SOURCE/sql/backups/mysql.last.  You
	should NOT need those for much of anything.
5) if you want to update the test database system, use the script `mktestdb`, which must
	be run as a user who has admin rights to the database.  the account csteele is 
	setup as being able to run commands as root via the sudo command, so you could 
	run this command like:

		sudo SOURCE/bin/mktestdb

	and it would do the trick.
