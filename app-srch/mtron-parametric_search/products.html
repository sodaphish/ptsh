<font size=+2><b>Crystals</b></font>
<P>A crystal is an electronic component based on quartz technology. The
properties of quartz allow for precise timing over a broad temperature 
range.
The frequency of a crystal can remain as precise as
+/- 20ppm or 0.002% over a temperature range of -40 to 85
C. A crystal must be placed in an oscillator circuit in order to
operate.</P><B>
<P>Frequency:</B> The main component and purpose of a crystal. Cycles
per second
generated or Hz. This parameter is usually specified in
MegaHertz(MHz)</P><B>
<P>Tolerance:</B> The accuracy of the crystal at 25
C,
a parameter needed to allow for error in quartz manufacturing process.
Specified
in parts per million(ppm) </P><B>
<P>Stability:</B> The accuracy achieved over the operating temperature
range so,
naturally, a temperature range must also be specified. Specified in 
parts per
million(ppm)</P>
<P>Tolerance and stability are specified as maximum values and added
together to
represent the absolute maximum frequency drift of the crystal. </P><B>
<P>Temperature range:</B> Operating temperature range of the crystal.
Specified
in degrees Celsius (C).</P><B>
<P>Shunt capacitance:</B> The internal capacitive value of the crystal.
Specified in pico Farads (pF).</P><B>
<P>ESR:</B> Effective Series Resistance or internal resistive value of
the
quartz. Specified in Ohms.</P><B>
<P>Load capacitance:</B> The value of the external load needed in order
for the
crystal to run at optimal operation. Specified in pico Farads
(pF)</P><B>
<P>Drive Level:</B> Maximum power rating of crystal. Specified in max
milliWatts(mW). Exceeding this rating could damage the crystal.</P><B>
<P>Package:</B> M-tron has a variety of crystal packages available in
surface
mount and through hole configurations. </P>

<font size=+2><b>Oscillators</b></font>
<P>Crystal oscillators are electronic components based on quartz
crystals. In
order to get a crystal to operate, an oscillator circuit must be
utilized. These
packaged oscillators eliminate the need to design an oscillator circuit
in order
to get a crystal to function. Because they are based on quartz crystals,
the
same frequency vs. temperature characteristics are observed.</P><B>
<P>Temperature Range:</B> Expected operating temperature of the device.
Specified in degrees Celsius (C).</P><B>
<P>Stability:</B> Absolute frequency drift expected to occur. In most
cases this
includes tolerance at 25 (C), frequency
vs.
temperature, load, supply voltage. Specified in parts per million
(ppm).</P><B>
<P>Output type: </B>Fixed or Tristate or Dual Complementary. Fixed
output is
always outputting a signal as long as power is applied. Tristate refers
to being
able to "disable" the output into a state of high impedance. Dual
complementary
option is popular in ECL/PECL logic and has outputs Q and Q-not. </P><B>
<P>Symmetry/Logic:</B> Logic Compatibility of output and duty cycle or
symmetry
of waveform.</P><B>
<P>Package:</B> M-tron has a variety of oscillator packages available in
surface
mount and through hole configurations.</P><B>
<P>Aging:</B> The ability to stay within tolerance over a long period of
time.</P>


<br><br>
<font size=+2><b>VCXOs</b></font>
<P>Voltage Controlled Crystal Oscillators (VCXOs) are oscillators
with the
ability to vary in frequency by varying the level of a control voltage.
These
VCXOs can be varied by as much as +/-
300ppm or 0.03% of
its center frequency.</P><B>
<P>Temperature Range:</B> Expected operating temperature of the device.
Specified in degrees Celsius (C).</P><B>
<P>Stability:</B> Absolute frequency drift expected to occur. In most
cases this
includes tolerance at 25 (C), frequency
vs.
temperature, load, supply voltage. Specified in parts per million
(ppm).</P><B>
<P>Output type:</B> Tristate or Voltage controlled or Dual
Complementary.
Voltage controlled is a non-tristate output that is only controlled by a
control
voltage. Tristate refers to being able to "disable" the output into a
state of
high impedance while still having the voltage control option. Dual
complementary
option is popular in ECL/PECL logic and has outputs Q and Q-not. </P><B>
<P>Pull Range:</B> The total amount of variance the VCXO can be offset
from its
center frequency. Specified in parts per million (ppm). </P><B>
<P>Symmetry/Logic:</B> Logic Compatibility of output and duty cycle or
symmetry
of waveform.</P><B>
<P>Package:</B> M-tron has a variety of oscillator packages available in
surface
mount and through hole configurations.</P><B>
<P>Aging</B>: The ability to stay within tolerance over a long period of

time.</P>

<br><br>
<font size=+2><b>TCXOs and DCXOs</b></font>
<P>Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillators (TCXOs) are
oscillators with the
ability to achieve up to +/- 1ppm stability.
A DCXO, or
Digitally Compensated Crystal Oscillator, is TCXO using digital
techniques to
provide stability of +/- 0.1ppm. </P><B>
<P>Temperature Range:</B> Expected operating temperature of the device.
Specified in degrees Celsius (C).</P><B>
<P>Stability:</B> Absolute frequency drift expected to occur. In most
cases this
includes tolerance at 25 (C), frequency
vs.
temperature, load, supply voltage. Specified in parts per million
(ppm).</P><B>
<P>Output type:</B> Fixed or Voltage controlled. Fixed output is always
outputting a signal as long as power is applied. Voltage controlled 
option
allows for additional tuning of a TCXO with the use of a control voltage
pin.</P><B>
<P>Symmetry/Logic:</B> Logic Compatibility of output and duty cycle or
symmetry
of waveform. In TCXOs, in addition to logic output, a sinewave or
clipped
sinewave output is also available.</P><B>
<P>Package:</B> M-tron has a variety of oscillator packages available in
surface
mount and through hole configurations.</P><B>
<P>Aging:</B> The ability to stay within tolerance over a long period of
time.</P>
