TODO:
** implement categories for each ban
** make categories dynamic from the database and as such managed through banman
** allow bans to be marked as private (e.g. so they aren't exported to UAA or visible in the exported ban lists)
** centralize configuration across all applications so they pull config data from a database
** write configuration loaders for php, python and perl -- this will very likely be another reusable chunk of code like Logger
** make all configuration settings editable via banman (or similar interface)
** use Smarty templates throughout all applications to separate the code from the layout.
** migrate ban.py to log to a database
** make banman's server list editable (so we don't have to add/delete to make changes.)
** write interface to update RCON across all servers using drcon.py
** import historical ban information into the database
** rewrite ban history thing to query the database written by ban.py
** log trending data to the database
** rewrite servergraph.php to query the trending data from the database
** breakout python classes into separate files so we only maintain one set of them
** make MOTD a database entry and allow it to be updated via banman.php
** fix bugs in the playlist class(es)
** fix bugs in the logquery
** write install script
