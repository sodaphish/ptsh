		<h2>Sample text:</h2>
		<p><b>Jean-Paul Sartre, (1905-1980)</b> born in Paris in 1905, studied at the École 
		Normale Supérieure from 1924 to 1929 and became Professor of Philosophy at Le Havre
		in 1931. With the help of a stipend from the Institut Français he studied in Berlin
		(1932) the philosophies of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. After further teaching
		at Le Havre, and then in Laon, he taught at the Lycée Pasteur in Paris from 1937 to 1939.
		Since the end of the Second World War, Sartre has been living as an independent writer.</p>

		<h3>More on JPS</h3>
		<p>The conclusions a writer must draw from this position were set forth in 
		"Qu'est-ce que la littérature?" (What Is Literature?), 1948: literature is
		no longer an activity for itself, nor primarily descriptive of characters 
		and situations, but is concerned with human freedom and its (and the author's)
		commitment. Literature is committed; artistic creation is a moral activity.</p>

			<p>Sartre is one of those writers for whom a determined philosophical position is the 
			centre of their artistic being. Although drawn from many sources, for example, 
			Husserl's idea of a free, fully intentional consciousness and Heidegger's existentialism,
			the existentialism Sartre formulated and popularized is profoundly original. 
			Its popularity and that of its author reached a climax in the forties, and Sartre's 
			theoretical writings as well as his novels and plays constitute one of the main inspirational
			sources of modern literature. In his philosophical view atheism is taken for granted; the
			"loss of God" is not mourned. Man is condemned to freedom, a freedom from all authority,
			which he may seek to evade, distort, and deny but which he will have to face if he is to
			become a moral being. The meaning of man's life is not established before his existence.
			Once the terrible freedom is acknowledged, man has to make this meaning himself, has to 
			commit himself to a role in this world, has to commit his freedom. And this attempt to
			make oneself is futile without the "solidarity" of others.</p>
