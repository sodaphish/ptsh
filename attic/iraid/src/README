Architecture
============================================================

DSM has four primary components: the subscriber agent, the
broker, the provider agent, and the marketplace.  Each of
these components relies on the Distributed Storage Model.

Each of these five foundational concepts is described in 
further detail below.


SUBSCRIBER AGENT (SA)
The subscriber agent (SA), broadly speaking, monitors the
subscriber's local storage and pushes modified files up to 
the broker.  While this process sounds trivial at first 
blush, there is a tremendous amount of intelligence that 
goes in to ensuring that the content uploaded by a 
subscriber is properly secured and distributed.


BROKER
The broker is comprised of two components: a distribution
back-end, and a subscriber front-end.

PROVIDER AGENT (PA)

MARKETPLACE (MP)

DISTRIBUTED STORAGE MODEL (DSM)
The Distributed Storage Model (heretoafter reffered to simply as "DSM") 
is a package that provides the base classes and interfaces to the data 
objects required to provide the functionality of the agents.  Broadly, 
there are separate modules within DSM that address the specific 
functionality of both the subscriber and provider agent environments

	Dir   - 
	File	- Complex file object for local files
	UFile - Universal file object for files stored on provider and broker systems
	UDir 	- Universal directory object for directory objects that are stored 
	Store

BROKER STORAGE MODEL (BSM)







DB SCHEMA
============================================================

config
	key = unique key string
	value = multi-typed value of the key

	special keys:
		schema_ver: the version of the database schema

files
	fileid = UUID of file
	filename = filename
	checksum = hex repr of sha1 sum of file
	metadata = file meta data (e.g. stat())
