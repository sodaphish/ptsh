ABOUT:
 httpget.pl was originally inspired by slashd, the slashdot daemon, 
 but was adapted to my own personal portal needs.  I now use 
 httpget.pl for quite a bit of remote retrieval of files that I 
 would really like to have.  For instance I have my own custom portal,
 it has news from several of the sites I visit regularly, as well as
 weather reports, and the latest daily of my favorite cartoons (go 
 userfriendly, dilbert and after y2k!)... now, THAT is application.
