crashbag v0.0.1 by SodaPhish

This is my kiddie crashbag... it contains a substantial subset of the 
tools I might use whilst compramising a host further.  This kit doesn't 
(and will never) contain my rtkt, which must be downloaded separately.

If you can think of something to add to this, please feel free.

Current Contents:
* dsniff v.2.3
* sleuthkit v.1.66
* john v.1.6

* nmap v.2.54BETA31
