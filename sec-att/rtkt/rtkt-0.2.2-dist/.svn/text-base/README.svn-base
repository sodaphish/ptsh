This is a rootkit.  The purpose of this kit is to maintain control of 
conquered boxen.  This kit is simple, it contains three features that
are worthy of note: the binary wrappers, the simple root-shell, and 
(most importantly) the kit's own protection.

The binary wrappers basically cover your tracks from the sys-admins who
might otherwise want to see what you're up to, while the rooshell provides
you simple and quick access back in to the box.  The real beauty though is
the kit's built-in ability to protect itself.  Basically, the kit takes
advantage of some features in most Linux file systems to make itself 
extremely difficutl to remove -- between `chattr` and the Linux kernel 
support for the POSIX.1e standard, it is possible to render some files 
almost impossible to remove or otherwise change.

Though this kit won't get you in, it will go a long way to help you stay in.
