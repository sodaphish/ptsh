rtkt-0.3.0 by SodaPhish

This is a rootkit.  The purpose of this kit is to maintain control of 
conquered boxen.  This kit is simple, it contains three features that
are worthy of note: the binary wrappers, the protected rootshell, and 
(most importantly) the kit's own protection.

The binary wrappers basically cover your tracks from the sys-admins who
might otherwise want to see what you're up to, while the rootshell provides
you simple and quick access back in to the box.  The real beauty though is
the kit's built-in ability to protect itself.  Basically, the kit takes
advantage of some features in POSIX.1e standards to make itself extremely 
difficutl to remove -- between `chattr` and the Linux kernel support, it 
is possible to render some files almost impossible to remove or otherwise 
change.  This kit does not use any loadable kernel modules, and is therefore
more portable than other rootkits that rely on LKM's to remain hidden.

Though this kit won't get you in, it will go a long way to help you stay in.
